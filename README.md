# Performence-analysis-of-Apriori-algorithm-using-MongoDB-And-MySQL

   Nowadays we need to work with a huge amount of data in some companies 
the average amount of records are 3-4 billion per day. In this situation work with
SQL server backend that collects and stores an extremely large amount of records.
It can crash because it is very time-consuming to get table records.

   To overcome this problem NoSQL database comes into the field. Dozens
of NoSQL data stores are available MongoDB is one of them. It is an open-source
document database. It usually does not have a schema. It has more few features
like Document-oriented means instead of having data in relational type format, it
stores the data in the document. This makes MongoDB very flexible and
adaptable to real business world situations and requirements. Ad hoc queries
MongoDB supports search by field, range queries, and regular expression
searches. Indexing- index can be created to improve the performance of searches
within MongoDB. Replication- MongoDB can provide high ability with replica
sets. Load balancing- MongoDB can run over multiple servers, balancing the load
and/or duplicating data to keep the system up and running in case of hardware
failure.

   Our software is project helpful too for people who are used to structure
database queries and learning MongoDB. The project Performance analysis of
the Apriori Algorithm using MongoDB provides lots of features. In the current
system, we have few on our hands but in the future, we will enhance it with more
features. The application has a good appearance and is easy to surf. It has very
simple source code which saves time. This project contains advanced modules
like MongoDB which makes the system very powerful.
